Kora allows users to build digital repository projects around a variety of digitized and born digital objects, such documents, images, audio, video, and 3D models. Beyond digital objects, Kora also allows users to include non-material culture entities, such as events or people, in their digital repository project. Kora\u2019s architecture and user experience is centered around providing an unprecedented level of flexibility in a project's metadata structure. This flexibility allows users to create multiple forms for record creation, each with their own robust structure and metadata scheme. This flexibility allows institutions, projects, and individual scholars to customize Kora to meet the unique needs of their particular project or collection. Kora is designed for multiple collaborators and distributed record creation and management. Users can work on the same project from anywhere in the world as long as they have access to the web. Each project in a Kora installation includes granular control over user permissions. Project administrators aren\u2019t locked into specific types of users with fixed permissions. Instead, they can flexibly create different types of user permission groups that meet the needs of their project and collaborators. Users can be added and removed from those permission groups as the needs of the project dictates. A single installation of Kora can support any number of discreet digital repository projects, thereby making it a perfect solution for institutions and individuals looking for a single solution to support a variety of digital collections. While each project in a Kora installation is a silo with its own users and records, users can search across all projects in an installation for which they have access. This makes Kora a perfect solution for institutions interested in managing separate collections or projects under the same institutional umbrella. In addition, the Kora API can be used to display records (including searching and browsing) in a public facing website from across multiple projects in one Kora installation. In order to support data portability and project workflows, Kora includes powerful import and export tools. Records (object + metadata) can be imported as XML, JSON, and CSV and exported as XML or JSON individually or in a batch. In keeping with the need to ensure authenticity and integrity of uploaded and imported files, Kora automatically generates fixity information on all ingested files, which can be used to verify that files are free from tampering and corruption.

Or maybe you are unfamiliar with a colleagues repository and need to find some of the records they've created for a particular project. Kora will allow you to search for these forms to find these records in no time. The documentation on Navigating to a Form is useful for when you know what project the form should be in, but sometimes you may want to search across Kora to find the exact form that you need. There are several ways to do this. The main difference is whether you want to search for a form across an entire installation, or if you are looking for a form within a particular project. Searching Across a Kora Installation At the navigation bar at the top of the page, is a magnifying glass icon. No matter what page you are on, this navigation bar and icon should be available, clicking on it will allow you to search for any forms within the Kora Installation that you have access to. Follow these steps to search for a form using this method: Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner within the navigation bar. A search bar will appear which will allow you to enter keywords found within the form title you are searching for. If you are able to enter the name of your form, the option to Go to Form will be made available under the search bar. Simply click on your form name to go to that form. However, sometimes you will not know the exact name of the form. In these cases, if you get close to the spelling of the form, Kora may still be able to provide options for you to jump to. If Kora still is not able to find your form in the initial typing into the search bar, then you will have to click the right-facing arrow in the search bar to perform a proper search. This search will examine records, forms, fields and projects for any results which may match your search. In this case, by clicking on the Forms() tab, you'll be able to see which forms match your search. Searching for a Form within a Project If you know what project a form may be in, it might be easier to search within a particular project for a form. There are a couple of ways to do this. The first option is to use the Find a Form search option located on the Project Home page. Navigate to the project you want to search and click on the Find a Form search bar. Entering the title of your form will eliminate all forms that do not match its spelling You are able to use a fewer amount of characters to broaden the possible forms that you will find. The other option for searching for a form involves jumping to a form using the navigation bar. This will create a list of forms that you can peruse to see if you find the form that you are looking for. Go to the arrow next to your project name in the navigation bar, or open up the dropdown menu to the very right. Select Jump to Form + and scroll through the possible forms.

This includes text, number, list, data, file and specialty fields. Understanding what these field types bring to the table will allow you to create spaces for data entry that are relevant to your digital repository. Creating a field is the first step towards understanding field types. After choosing to create a field and selecting the Field Type drop-down menu, you'll find the field type options available. These options will determine what types of data are entered into a record . The headings below will discuss the field types by their category: text, number, list, date, file, and specialty. After selecting your field type, you can click on Show Advanced Field Options . This is where you will be able to view many of the options for customizing your fields discussed below. Text Fields Text field are fields in which you enter text. There are two types of text field: text field and rich text field . Text A text field allows users to enter any plain text into a record. This can include characters, numbers, and symbols from your keyboard. The advanced field options available include: a Default value, a Regex pattern and whether or not to make the field Multilined . Default : inputting a default value for a text field will create a value that is always present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but it will be initially present for every record containing this text field . Regex : A Regex pattern allows you to customize how a text field is searched for within Kora. For instance, if a word has multiple ways of being spelled, you can specify the different ways that a text field may be entered: the regular expression seriali[sz]e matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". There are also much more complex regex expressions you can learn how to write. Multilined? : The multilined option allows you to enter more than one line of plain text, by clicking the enter button. There is no set limit to the number of lines you can enter, and a scroll bar will appear if the lines appear out of the text field's view. Rich Text A rich text field allows you write text that can be stylized and edited with the CKE editor. There are numerous options available in this editor to manipulate text. Users will be able to italicize, bold, underline, and strikethrough their text. They can also insert tables and images headings, bulleted lists and numbered lists into text. Users are then able to run spellcheck, insert links, and change other aspects of their text. The user guide for the CKE editor can be found here (They do not have a user guide up and running yet) . There are no advanced options available for this field besides the creation of a default value. Default : Default text can be entered into this field. The entered text will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this rich text field . Number Fields Number fields allows you to enter numbers. Users may enter the numbers manually into this field using a keyboard. Alternatively, users are able to use arrow keys or scroll with their mouse wheel to move the number value up or down by 1. There are two types of number fields: integer field and float field . Integer Integer fields use whole numbers as their values. These are numbers without decimal points, and they can include negative numbers. If you attempt to enter a value that is not a whole number, then the value will not appear in the record. The advanced field options available include: a Default value, a Minimum Value , a Max Value and Unit of Measurement . Default : A default number can be entered into this field. The entered number will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this integer field . Minimum Value : This specifies the lowest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is lower than this minimum value, Kora will not accept the minimum value. The record will either not be created, or it will shift to the minimum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified minimum value. Max Value : This specifies the highest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is higher than this Max value, Kora will not accept the maximum value. The record will either not be created, or shift to the maximum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified max value. Unit of Measurement : A unit of measurement can be specified for the integer value. Any plaintext value can be entered and will show up to the field name in parentheses when entering the record. Float Float fields can take in any real numbers as their value. These real numbers can include integers and negative numbers. The advanced field options are exactly the same as the previous section and include: a Default value, a Minimum Value , a Max Value and Unit of Measurement . Default : A default number can be entered into this field. The entered number will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this float field . Minimum Value : This specifies the lowest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is lower than this minimum value, Kora will not accept the minimum value. The record will either not be created, or it will shift to the minimum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified minimum value. Max Value : This specifies the highest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is higher than this Max value, Kora will not accept the maximum value. The record will either not be created, or shift to the maximum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified max value. Unit of Measurement : A unit of measurement can be specified for the float value. Any plaintext value can be entered and will show up to the field name in parentheses when entering the record. List Fields The Lists field allow users to create lists of data or select list options from a controlled vocabulary. Users are also able to generate a list, or create a list of objects associated with other objects. Perhaps the greatest strength of lists is the ability to force users to enter in controlled vocabulary for data fields. Controlled vocabulary refers to the use of a specific terms to refer to your data. If you only have three possible options for a particular value, then that makes it easier to characterize and analyze the data. You don't have to worry about the particular differences in how people describe objects or spelling errors. The trade-off is a loss of nuance. It is up to form creators to decide which goals are important to them. Their are four types of list fields available: list field , multi-select list , generated list and combo list . Note, if your list item contains any commas you must encapsulate the entire list item within quotation marks. List A list field is the most straightforward list option available. You may create a list of possible values (a.k.a a controlled vocabulary) from which users may select one value for the data field. A list field will appear as a dropdown menu from which you can select one of these values when creating a record. Many of the options mentioned here are available for all lists and so will refer back to this section. So, when creating any list you may follow these steps in the advanced options to create that list: Under list options, enter your possible values in the green box labeled Type here and hit the enter key or \"ADD\" to add a new list option . From there hit enter or press the \"ADD\" button to add your value to the list. Your new value (\"Option 1\" in the image below) will be added to the list options above the green box you entered your data into. You can continue to add values in the bottom green box which will appear in the order created. You may also Copy All List Options or Delete All List Options . Copying list options will put all list options into your clipboard, separated by commas. Deleting all list options will delete all the values you have entered into a list. You will receive a notification asking you to confirm that you really do want to delete all your list options in a pop-up. You are able to move your list options around by clicking on the arrows next to the list options you have created. Clicking on an up arrow will switch that list option with the option below it, while clicking on a down arrow will switch that list option with the option below it. You may also click and drag a list option to a different part of the list. Once you have added all your list options, you are able to save your controlled vocabulary as preset for other lists by pressing the Create a New Value Preset button. You will have to give your list a name and decide if you want forms across your project to be able to use your preset list. You may also select Use a Value Preset for these List Options to select any preset lists that have been created and made available. You may also select from a selection of default preset lists made available across Kora which includes: Boolean, Country, Languages, and U.S States. At the bottom of list options, you will see that you can specify default values for your list. For the list field type, you may only specify one default value. In other multi-select, generated, and combo lists, you are able to specify more than one value. The default value for any list can be changed by the person making the record, but the default value will always be initially chosen when creating a record. Multi-Select List A multi-select list field creates a list of possible values (a.k.a. a controlled vocabulary) from which users may select multiple values for the data field. This field follows the same setup as a list field (see steps 1-5 for list field above), but the end result is the ability to select multiple list options from a single list. You may select list options from a multi-select list by clicking them in the drop-down menu. You may also remove selected items by clicking the x * next to the field option. Generated List A generated list enables users to create and edit a list while creating a record. Users enter their own list options as if they were creating their own list field. This means that there are steps to create a generated list in a record, and steps to create a generated list in a form. The process of creating a generated list in a record is outlined in steps 1-3 of the list field section above. Users will enter, delete and rearrange their list options in the same way that list options are created when making a list field. Creating a generated list field in a form provides you with similar advanced options as other lists (steps 1-5 in the list field above), but there are a couple of key differences. First, there is the ability to add a regex expression, which can modify how Kora searches for your field. Secondly, it is important to note that any list options that you add in the advanced options will not show in the generated list that appears when creating a record. That means no default values can be specified or already existing list options added. Users will always have to generate the list from scratch when using a generated list. Combo List A combo list field type allows users to select values from two different field types and associate those values with each other in one list. It is the only list field option that does not follow the steps outlined in the list field above. Instead, follow these steps to create a combo list: In the advanced options of a combo list, you will find the boxes shown in the image below available. The two boxes on the left named Combo List Field Type allow you to select the field types you want for this list. You may select any field type except for File Fields. The boxes on the right named Combo List Field Name allow you to give names to those fields. Here is an example setup in the advanced options. This combo list will use text and date fields to combine the names and birthdays of individuals into a single list. Note that you are unable to edit the advanced options of these individual fields. You Combo List will appear empty when creating a record as shown below. To add paired values to this list, click on the Add New Value button. The individual options for the field types you have selected will be available when adding a new value. In name and birthday example from the previous step, a text field is available for 'Name', while a date field is available for 'Birthday'. Click Create Combo Value to add the desired values to the list. You may add any number of combined values. Date Fields Date fields allow users to enter temporal data when creating records. There are three field types available for these purposes: Date , Date Time and Historical Date . Date The date field allows users to enter a month, day and year. The advanced field options available include: Default month, day and year; Date Format , Start Year , End Year and the ability to specify the current year as the start or end year. Default : a default month, day and/or year can be chosen for the date field type . Default dates are changeable, but will appear initially every time a record using that date field is created. Date Format : use this option to rearrange the order of how the month, date and year appear when making the record. Start Year : this option allows you to specify the earliest year available for users to enter. Users will not be able to enter dates before the start year into records. End Year : this option allows you to specify the latest year that is available for users to enter. Users will not be able to enter dates after this end year into records. Use Current Year as Start Year : if you only want users to be able to enter recent dates, you can select the current year as the start year for dates to be entered. Use Current Year as End Year : if you want users to be able to enter dates up to the current year, select this option to make dates up to this year available. Date Time The date time field type provides everything that the date field type provides, plus time. The Advanced options for a date time field also follow this same logic. Default hour, minutes and seconds are the only advanced option which differ for this field type and they are outlined in the image below. Check out the section on the date field type above to learn more about the other advanced options Default : the date time field type gives the additional option to specify a default hour, minute and second. Default times are changeable, but will appear initially every time a record using that date time field is created. Historical date A historical date field type provides everything that the date field type provides, plus the ability to add prefixes and calendar notation to the dates. The advanced options for this field type are similar to the date time field, except a few advanced options: Select Prefix(Optional) , Select Calendar/Date Notation , Show Prefixes? and Show Calendar/Date Notation? . The advanced options unique to the historical date field type are outlined below. Check out the section on the date field type above to learn more about the other advanced options. Select Prefix(Optional) : prefixes are selected by clicking the circle to the left of their name. The prefixes available include circa, pre and post. Circa refers to approximate or estimated dates. Pre refers to times before the specified date. Post refers to times after the date. You may only select one prefix. Select Calendar/Date Notation : calendar and date notation are selected by clicking the circle to the left of their name. CE refers to common era; BCE refers to before common era, BP refers to before present (oftentimes this means the year 1950 CE); and KYA years often refers to thousands of years before present. You must select one calendar/date notation. Show Prefixes? : If you want your selected prefix to appear when creating and viewing records, then select 'yes' from the drop-down menu. Show Calendar/Date Notation? if you want your selected notation to appear when creating and viewing records then select 'yes' from the drop-down menu. File Fields File Fields allow you to create fields were users can upload files to a record. This includes documents, images, audio, video and 3D models. The image below shows what a typical file field looks like. There will be a title, a space to upload your file, and a description below. The File Field Types are: Documents , Gallery , Playlist , Video and 3D-Model . Note: When you are uploading any files, there are some restrictions on filenames. They are limited to a-z , A-Z , 0-9 , . , - and _ . No spaces are permitted in filenames. Documents The documents file field creates a space for document files to be uploaded. Since there are multiple types of files that documents can come in, you must select the document file types that you want to upload. You can customize the types of files you want uploaded and how you want them uploaded with the advanced options available: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types (MIME): . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types (MIME): : this is were you will select the types of files that you want to accept for a document upload. You may want only .pdf or .png files to be uploaded. Due to the wide variety of formats that documents typically come in, no default values are selected for document uploads and there are a wide variety of file types available for selection. This differs from other file fields in because you must choose a document type for it to be possible to upload files. Gallery The gallery file field creates a data field which allows users to upload images. Standard file formats are already selected for this field and include: .jpg, .gif, .png, and .bmp image files. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types: : the file types provided are already optimized for typical image file formats including: jpg, gif and png and bmp image files. These are the only file types you may choose from. Playlist The playlist file field creates a space for users to upload audio files when making a record. Standard file formats are already selected for this field and include: MP3 and WAV audio files. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types : the file types provided are already optimized for typical audio file formats including: MP3 and WAV audio files. These are the only file types you may choose from. Video The video file field creates a space for users to upload video files when making a record. There is only one standard file formats selected for this field which is MP4. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types: : the MP4 file type provided is the only file format available for videos. This is the only file types you may choose from. 3D model The 3D model file field creates a space for users to upload 3D models into a record. There are standard file formats already selected for 3D models which include: OBJ, STL, JPEG Texture, PNG Texture, and other. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields, but include some notable differences: Max File Size (kb) , Allowed File Types , Model Color , Background Color One , and Background Color Two . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Allowed File Types: : the file types provided are already optimized for typical 3D model file formats including: OBJ, STL, JPEG Texture, PNG Texture and other. Model Color : allows you to choose the color of the 3D Model Background Color One : allows you to choose the first background color of the model environment Background Color Two : allows you to choose the second background color of the model environment. Specialty Fields There are a number of different Specialty Fields which serve specific functions for form creators. These functions allow users to create true or false options, describe geographic location and associate records with other records. These field types are referred to respectively as: Boolean , Geolocator , and Associator fields. Boolean The boolean field refers to a true or false field option. You are able to make a title and description for a boolean field, which the person entering data may check or uncheck by clicking on the circle. You may automatically have the boolean field selected by checking the default option in the advanced options of the boolean field you are creating or editing. Geolocator The geolocator field allows users to enter geographic data through the use of latitude/longitude (lat/long), and address data. When entering new geolocator data, users enter the name of the new location, what type of geographic data they are entering (lat/long or address) and then the actual data. This field provides three advanced options when customizing this field: Default Locations , Map Display and Displayed Data . Default Locations : this advanced field option allows you to enter default locations for a geolocator field. You will enter the location name, location type and data in the same way as a new record. The image below shows the pop-up that appears for entering new locations into a geolocator field. Map Display : This advanced option allows you to display a map with points using entered location data. The points will appear on an interactive map which will automatically zoom to fit all of your points. Viewing records with map display active will show this map when examining records. If map display is inactive then no interactive map will be available for locations entered using Geolocator data. Instead, the raw text for the name of the location, and it's location data will be displayed. Displayed Data : If you choose not to display a map using the Map Display option, then Kora will display your data as text. There are two types of location data that you are able to display when viewing records: Lat Long and Address . Displaying Lat Long will display the coordinates of your location using latitude and longitude coordinates. Likewise, selecting Address will display the address of your locations. If a record provides latitude and longitude, Kora will still be able to look up an associated address to display if that is the option that is chosen. The opposite is also true. Associator An associator field creates connections between records. Let's say, for example, that you want to create a form that keeps track of people associated with a museum project. This could include supervisors, volunteers, archaeologists, etc. Individual records could be created with their names and roles. Now let's say you want to create another form for objects associated with this project. You could create records which include data on these objects and the people involved with the curation of those objects. This could potentially be a lot of data reentry, however. One solution Kora offers for this hypothetical problem is the ability to associate the object records from the one form with the people records from the other form. When an association is created within a record, the associator field displays your selected, associated record as a clickable link within that original record. This link will bring you to the record page for that associated record. The possible association are extremely flexible, in that you are able to associate records with other records from the same form or even records from another project's form. In order to do this, however, you will need to give forms the ability to search each other through Form association permissions . What follows are directions for: creating association permissions between forms; setting up the search configurations for an associator field, and how to use an associator field. Associator Permissions Follow these steps to set up associator permissions: First, you will want to navigate to the desired form that you want to associate other records with. From there you will have to select Association Permissions from either dropdown menu shown below. This will bring you to the Form Associations Page which allows you to grant association access with other forms. If you have administrative access to the forms that you want to associate, select Create a New Form Association . A new box will appear asking you Create a New Form Association . The dropdown menu will initially ask you to select a form. Forms will be displayed here from any project you have access to through a \"project name - form name\" format. Select the form you want to create an association with and click Create a New Form Association . Forms that are allowed to be associated with will be listed at the bottom of the Form Associations Page . If you do not have administrative permissions to a form, you may select the Request Form Access tab. Clicking Request Form Access on that page will allow you to select a form, after which Kora will send an email to all administrators requesting access to form associations. Association Search Configuration Now that you have the correct association permissions set up for your form, you can create an association field that will be able to search records from other forms. In the directions below, we will be creating an associator field that is able to search for records through another form called \"Form 2\". These setup steps will work for any associator field: First go to the advanced options for the associator when creating the field . There you will find the Association Search Configuration , which will have the forms that you are able to search through available to be checked off. Once you have selected the form that you want this field to associate with, you will have the option to select preview values. Preview values will show any values from the selected fields you choose when searching for records. If you do not select a preview value, then the internal Kora Identification (KID) will be the only value that is shown when searching for records with this associator. It is recommended that you choose a field such as \"name\", \"id\", etc. that will allow you to more easily identify what record you are looking at. After your search configuration is set up, you can create a default value for the associator field. Go to the next section for directions on how to use an associator field. How to Use an Associator Field After setting up the permissions and search configurations for an associator field as outlined in the previous sections, you will now be able to associate records from your form with records from other desired forms. Follow these steps to associate records using an associator field: When using an associator field, the first thing you must do is search for a record to associate with. You must search for records by entering key terms or a known KID (Kora Identification number) under Search Associations . In the image below, we search for \"Jane Doe\" Results of your search will show up in the next section labeled Association Results . Results will show up as the KID separated from any preview values you have chosen (step 2 in search configuration). Because we selected a preview value to display a name, we are extra sure that this is the correct record for \"Jane Doe\". Click on the record(s) that you want to appear as associations. Selected association will then appear in the Selected Associations section. You may continue to search for new records to associate by repeating steps 1 & 2. You may also remove selected associations by clicking on the x next to their text.","title":"Understanding Field Types"},{"location":"forms/understanding_field_types/#understanding-field-types","text":"Each form has to ability to add any number of different fields across multiple pages .

Using mod_rewrite in Kora If your installation will exist at a URL with a subdirectory, it is important to adjust the \".htaccess\" file inside of \"public\" to reflect this. Note : This is only applicable to a Kora installation accessible by subdirectory and not for one existing at a domain-level or subdomain-level URL. For an explanation of these circumstances, please see the \"Create Kora Installation URLs\" part of the Reclaim/DoOO Installation guide . If you have not yet done so, confirm that mod_rewrite . See \" Enabling mod_rewrite \" section of the \"System Requirements\" documentation. Edit the \".htaccess\" file inside the \"public\" directory. If using a cPanel interface, follow the instructions for editing files in \" Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager ,\" a section in the Installation guide. If using SSH or Terminal, navigate to \"kora/public\" and use sudo nano , this time to edit \".htaccess\". An explanation for using nano with super user privileges is also contained in the \" Enabling mod_rewrite \" section of the \"System Requirements\" documentation. The file's code will begin with: <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> <IfModule mod_negotiation.c> Options -MultiViews -Indexes </IfModule> RewriteEngine On #RewriteBase #add base url ex: www.website.com[/this part is your base url, the url subdirectory where you want your installation to be accessible from] #RewriteBase /your_base_url Remove the # from the final line above and provide the subdirectory part of your URL for accessing your installation. For instance, if you installed Kora and created a symbolic link to a directory within your root called \"kora\", the last few lines might look like: RewriteEngine On #RewriteBase #add base url ex: www.website.com[/this part is your base url, the url subdirectory where you want your installation to be accessible from] RewriteBase /kora Be sure to save your changes when exiting. Increasing Memory Usage and File Size Limits A Kora installation relies on default values for memory and storage usage by PHP. However, these will be set too low to handle Kora installations where large files will be uploaded to the installation, such as high-resolution images, image-dense pdfs, or 3D objects with detailed surface texture files. To deal with this, the \".htaccess\" file saved in the \"public\" directory contains a list of PHP attributes and associated increased values. In that file, they appear like this: #Recommended but only use these if your system allows overwrites #php_value upload_max_filesize 4998M #php_value post_max_size 4999M #php_value memory_limit 5000M #php_value max_execution_time 3000 #php_value max_input_time 3000 If your server environment allows overwrites via the .htaccess file, simply edit this file and remove the # before each attribute to enable the overwrite. For editing instructions, see links to multiple explanations in the section above, \" Using mod_rewrite in Kora \". In some cases however, such as in Domain of One's Own or other Reclaim Hosting -provided environments, these values cannot overwritten via this method. Instead, these values may be managed by the provided server graphical interface; in the case of Reclaim Hosting, this is the cPanel. In this example, these values are managed by a cPanel application called \"MultiPHP INI Editor.\" To adjust these values, begin by clicking on this application. Select the domain or subdomain where your installation is. All of the overwritable PHP attributes for the selected domain or subdomain will appear; find each of those listed in the code block above and adjust their values as necessary. Be sure to save the new settings. GitLab Integration Kora includes the option to allow users to sign up and log in using GitLab's authentication system, via their OAuth API. This can be implemented with any type of GitLab account or installation \u2013 including a gitlab.com free account, a GitLab Community Edition (CE) instance personally hosted, a GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) instance managed through gitlab.com, etc. \u2013 and will allow any user who has a legitimate account for that GitLab location (whether privately hosted or through gitlab.com) to authenticate their Kora account. Individual GitLab User Integration This option will be tied to one specific user's GitLab account. Begin by navigating to the GitLab instance you wish to use for this process and log in, then go to the account's settings page. In the left-hand sidebar, click on \"Applications\". This will default to showing the options for \"Add new application\" Fill in the required information for adding a new application. The name will be whatever identifying name you wish to give this newly-created link; it is recommended you reference this Kora installation's URL for specificity, but any name you choose will work. In the \"Redirect URI\" text box, use the following example to put in the URI for your specific Kora instance. In this example URI, the Kora instance's URL is at https://example.org/kora/, so this creates the URI of: https://example.org/kora/login/gitlab/callback Notice that what has been added to the URL is \"/login/gitlab/callback\" in order to create the URI. Leave the box for the setting \"Confidential\" checked; this is the default setting. Check the box for the \"read_user\" scope and then click \"Save application\" after the list of scopes. You will be redirected to the page with your \"Application ID\" and \"Secret.\" You will be copying each of these into your Kora Configuration File page of your installation. When viewing your installation's Kora Configuration File page (accessible via the right sidebar, under the \"Management\" section), type in the GitLab instance's website into the \"GitLab Client\" box. For instance, for a free account on gitlab.com, use \"https://gitlab.com\" Copy the GitLab \"Application ID\" from Step 7 above into the Kora Configuration Page box for \"GitLab Client ID\"; copy \"Secret\" to \"GitLab Client Secret.\" Click \"Update Configuration File\" to save these settings.

This architecture determines both how projects using Kora are structured as well as the workflow used by those working on the projects. In the case of Kora, this architecture is somewhat hierarchical, in which relevant components are nested within one another. In order to get the most out of Kora, it is important to understand these components, what role they play, and how the interact with one another. Kora Installation A Kora installation can have any number of discreet projects (more on Projects below). For the most part, each project in a Kora installation is its own silo. The only exception to this is that from within the Kora installation, admins can search across multiple project (cross project searching). In addition, the Kora API can be used to display (including searching and browsing) records from across multiple projects in one public website. While a Kora installation can contain any number of projects, you might also feel the need to install more than one instance of Kora on a server (to isolate one specific project in a container, for instance). To learn about what you need to install Kora on a server, check out System Requirements . If you are interested in installing Kora on Reclaim or Domain of One's Own, check out Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own and Reclaim Hosting There are some things that you can only do in Kora at the installation level (such as creating projects and managing Kora tokens and API requests). In addition, you can add users to a Kora installation, but not assign them to a particular project. This creates a pool of users that can easily be added to a project (or projects). All installation level settings and the ability to add users at the installation level (and assigning them to specific projects) is the domain of a Kora Admin. To learn more about Kora Admins (and all other user types), check out Understanding Kora User Types and Permissions . Project In Kora, a project is a digital repository. It has a particular theme or focus (a specific collection, for instance), and contains records (metadata + digital objects) related to that theme or focus, as well as forms for creating those records (more on that below). Each project has its own set of users (each of whom can have different privileges within that project). A Project Admin sits at the top of the user pyramid within a project. While they can't create new projects, they pretty much can do anything within the project for which they are an admin. This includes creating forms, editing forms, deleting forms, creating field value presets, importing and exporting forms, and managing user permissions. Form Forms are essentially the mechanism by which records are generated. In this regard, forms in Kora are analogous to paper forms. A paper form is meaningless until you fill it out - which creates a record of some sort. In Kora, forms (which live within a project) are filled out by a user, thereby generating a record. Forms are essentially data entry tools. The important thing to note is that forms create structured data. Each record created with a particular form will be structured in the exact same way. What a form looks like (the form's Field Types - more on that below) is determined by your project's metadata scheme. Like all digital repository, library, and archive projects, the metadata scheme is built and tuned in advance of any technical work. In the case of Kora, that metadata scheme would be used to create a project's forms. A project can have any number of different forms, each for a different type of record or object. So, for instance, if your project contained both historic documents and archaeological artifacts, you could create a form for each. When a user wanted to use generate a record for a document, they'd use the document form. When they wanted to generate a record for an artifact, they'd use the artifact form. In Kora, users can also connect two forms using an associator (which is a specific Field Type - more on those below). To learn more about Forms in Kora, start by reading Creating a Form . Field Types In Kora, Field Types are what makes a Form something you can actually fill out to create a record. Imagine a form that didn't have any text fields or checkboxes. This is a Form without Field Types. Kora has a wide variety of Field Types, each of which are purpose built to allow users to enter certain types of data. For instance the Geolocator Field type allows you to enter geospatial information (in the form of Lat/Long or an address), while a a Text Field (which is probably the most common Field Type) allows users to enter any plan text into a record. Kora also includes a variety of very specialized Field Types. One of the most powerful is the Associator , which allows you to create connections between records. To learn more about Kora's various Field Types, check out Understanding Field Types . Records Kora has a flexible approach to what it considers a record. For many digital repository and archive platforms, a record centers on a digital object (which is most often a digitized version of a physical object - a book, a document, a wax cylinder, an archaeological artifact). In the case of Kora, a record center a little more broadly on an entity - a person, a place, or a thing. A record is a collection of metadata that describes that entity. So, for instance, a Kora project could have place records, each of which is a collection of metadata that describes a specific place. That place record could also include multiple digital objects relevant to that place (historic photos, maps, etc) Similarly, a Kora project could have people records - each of which was a collection of metadata that described an individual. Kora can, of course, also have records for digitized physical objects. One of the interesting things about Kora is that you can associate (using the Associator field type) different relevant records. So, instead of including relevant digital images of an individual in their person record, the images would have their own records (each with robust metadata) that were then associated with the relevant person record. Records are generated by Forms, whose structure in determined by the project's metadata scheme for that type of entity (historic document, archaeological artifact, person, place, etc).

A few things about this guide. First, in many cases of naming something or writing Terminal commands, things will be case sensitive, so unless the specific instance requires uppercase for something, this guide will always use lowercase and its author strongly suggests you do the same. Keeping things all lowercase is a good thing to follow for best practices because it removes any doubt or confusion over whether some file, directory, or URL should have uppercase letters in it. Second, a note about terminology. To keep things consistent, this guide will be using the word \"directory\" and its derivatives throughout this guide, rather than \"folder\" in order to better illuminate the link between URL and file structure throughout this process. Finally, make sure to visit the Kora GitHub repo releases to download the zip file containing the most recent Kora release. Log In to cPanel Begin all of this by logging into your account to reach your cPanel. Most cPanels look something like this: Set up MySQL Database After reaching the cPanel for your server environment, begin by setting up the necessary MySQL Database for your Kora installation. Start by finding the section called \"Databases\" and clicking on \"MySQL Databases\". Under \"Create new Database,\" enter \"kora\" or some other name in the text field and click \"Create Database.\" Take note of the auto-generated prefix, which, when combined with whatever you just provided, will be the name of your MySQL database. In this example case it is called geyerbri_kora . Once you've noted this database name, click on the link to take you back to the previous page. Next, scroll down to \"MySQL Users\" and provide the username \"kora\" in the text box under \"Add New User\". This is a common practice \u2014 the database and the default user for that database having the same name \u2014 which will make it easier to update configurations elsewhere. After this, click on the button \"Password Generator.\" The Password Generator modal will open and generate a random string of characters (blocked out in the image below). IMPORTANT Copy this password to somewhere for safe-keeping. You will need it later for configuration of your Kora installation. After copying this password to somewhere, click \"Use Password.\" When the modal closes, the generated password will auto-fill into the \"Add New User\" section and it should rate the password as \"Very Strong.\" Click on \"Create User\" to complete this process. Just as you did with the database name, take note of this username, as you will need it for Kora configuration elsewhere. Because this guide follows the common practice of using the same name for the database and user, this example username is also geyerbri_kora . Click the back link to get back to the previous page. The final step in setting up the required MySQL database is to assign the newly-created user to the newly-created database and give that user full permissions. Do this by first scrolling down to \"Add User To Database\", confirming that the names are correctly chosen, and clicking on \"Add.\" The page that opens will provide a list of permissions that can be assigned to the chosen user for the specified database. Click the checkbox for \"ALL PRIVILEGES.\" Scroll down if needed to find the \"Make Changes\" box. Clicking on it will generate an in-page notification that it was successful. Click on the \"Go Back\" link to get back to the main \"MySQL Databases\" page. To confirm that you have successfully created the database, created the user, and added the user to the database, find the section \"Current Databases\" and check that there is an entry for your new database, with your new user listed as a privileged user. Return to cPanel Main To return from nearly any part of cPanel to the Main interface (shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this guide), you can click on the grid icon in the upper-left. Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager From cPanel Main, find the section \"Files\" and click on \"File Manager.\" Take a note of which directory is your main URL directory (the one that provides all the files available via your main URL). In this screenshot you can see the globe icon being used for the URL directory \"public_html,\" which is the common icon in this version of cPanel and used in MSU's Domain of One's Own. You may use this directory later, to confirm something in Step 3 of \"Subdirectory URL Setup Via cPanel Terminal,\" if following that path for creating your Kora installation URL (this will make sense later). You will also notice the same globe icon, but with a black chain-link icon over it, used for \"www\". This is something different, which will be explained in one of the sections about setting up the installation URL below. But for now just know that the directory with the globe and without the chain-link is the one you need to make note of. In order to properly view all the relevant Kora installation files once they have been created, it is important for you to make all the hidden files visible. To do this, go to the File Manager's \"Settings\" by clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right. Click the checkbox for \"Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)\" and then click \"Save\". Next, you'll upload the Kora installation .zip file you downloaded earlier from Kora's GitHub repo releases page. Kora is intended to be installed outside of the main URL directory you noted in Step 2 of this section, to keep it secure and reduce any chances of interference with any other website content you have in your server environment; the easiest is to install it into the same directory alongside your main URL directory. If you have never changed the default directory that loads when opening File Manager, you should be viewing the correct location, which in this example case is named after the user (\"geyerbri\"). While at this location, click on \"Upload\" in the menu at the top. In the page that opens, just drag-and-drop the .zip file to upload it. You may also click on \"Select File\" to find it via your computer's file management windows. When the .zip file finishes uploading, click on the link leading back to File Manager. Locate the uploaded .zip file in this directory, right-click it to bring up the context menu, and select \"Extract.\" In the Extract modal that opens, leave the default location alone (the text box is likely blank) and click \"Extract File(s).\" In the follow-up modal called \"Extraction Results,\" click \"Close.\" Extracting the .zip file will create a new directory, which is likely called \"kora-XXX,\" with the version number in the placeholder. Locate this directory, right-click on it, and select \"Rename.\" In the Rename modal that opens, change the text in the box to \"kora\" (without quotations) and click \"Rename File.\" Next, it's time to initially set up the .env file that manages some of the configuration settings for your Kora install. Many of the settings in this file will be adjustable once the installation is complete, but a few are not and require configuration now. Enter/access your renamed \"kora\" directory by double clicking on it, then right-click on the \".env.example\" file and select \"Copy.\" In the Copy modal that opens, add \"/.env\" without quotations to whatever is already in the text box and click \"Copy File(s).\" Once the file has been renamed, select it and then click on \"Edit\" in the menu at the top. The Edit modal that opens provides a warning to back up the file you are about to edit before making any changes. This is always a good practice to follow, so that any mistakes can be quickly and easily rectified. Luckily, since the file you are about to edit is a direct copy of \".env.example,\" you already have a backed-up copy of its current state, so in this case making an additional backup is not necessary. So go ahead and click on \"Edit.\" A new tab will open with the editor. Here, change lines 6, 7, and 8 to match the info you saved about your MySQL database. For example, given the info previously saved from the database setup before, this guide's example code would look like: DB_DATABASE=geyerbri_kora DB_USERNAME=geyerbri_kora DB_PASSWORD={saved database user password} Notice, this is where you will paste in the database password you saved in Step 5 of \" Set Up MySQL Database \" above. Remove the curl brackets from the example code and make sure there are no spaces before or after the password. After finishing this, click \"Save Changes\". Once that's done you can either close the tab or click \"Close\" (which does the same thing) and go back to the File Manager tab. Finally, there is one more example file to copy as a configuration file. Enter the directory \"public\" and also copy the file \".htaccess.example\". Add \"/.htaccess\" after the defaulted location, the same way you did for \".env\" in the previous step. The default settings in this file will work for basic installations of Kora, but should you want to adjust settings such as more complex URLs than what this guide presents (see \" Create Kora Installation URLs \" below), or to change the advanced settings such as acceptable file sizes, memory limits, timeout lengths, etc., they are controlled in this file. Once copied, you're finished with the initial file setup. Navigate back to cPanel Main. Kora Installation and Initial Configuration via cPanel Terminal In cPanel Main, scroll down to the section called \"Advanced\" and open \"Terminal.\" Read and (hopefully) accept the terms to reach the in-cPanel Terminal interface. It will look like this: In Terminal, you will be using some basic commands to move around and change a few things. The first one is cd , which just changes your location in the file system. Change your directory to whichever directory you just renamed the extracted zip file to. If you've been using the suggested names above, this will be \"kora\": cd kora Next, run the installation process: php artisan kora:install Before running this last command, the window will look like this: After running, if it is successful, the window will look like this, with the successful installation message (in green): Note If the installation fails and provides a message that says (in part) \"Failed to connect to database! Check your database credentials or review the logs for more error information,\" this may be due to some common problems and there are a few things to check before trying to run the installation command again. First, return to the MySQL section of cPanel to confirm you have written down the full database name and username correctly. Second, re-open the .env file where you earlier put that database information, to double-check that these names are correct. If they are, there may be an issue with the generated password for your MySQL user. You can go generate a new password, save it again, and enter it into the .env file, before once again trying to run the installation command. If the installation again fails, the issue may be something else. You can check for any similar issues and potential solutions in Kora's GitHub Issues , or open your own Issue with a detailed description of the problem. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT : You must copy the last line generated here in the successful installation message (outlined above), which has your password for the generated username of \"admin\". To copy things in cPanel's Terminal, first use your mouse to select the line, then right-click and select \"Copy.\" Paste this somewhere safe, where you will not lose it! Warning It cannot be stressed enough how important this step is, because losing this password means losing access to your installation and will require a full reinstallation. Notice that, in the successful installation message, you are directed to \"give READ access to the web user,\" as well as \"WRITE access\" for specific directories, to ensure that Kora continues functioning properly after users start contributing. What these directions require could be different for different Domain of One's Own environments, because different system administrators may have set up the default permissions for the environment differently. For now, to ensure that things are set up for the most likely scenario for most Domain of One's Own or Reclaim Hosting environments, you will be setting file permissions for the entire \"kora\" directory and its contents. Because these commands have to be applied to all the files and directories within, you will have to do this here, via Terminal, using the chmod command and the -R flag. chmod stands for \"change mode,\" which is how the server's operating system refers to changing permissions. The -R flag tells the command to run recursively, i.e. change them for this directory and everything it contains. Finally, the . is the short-hand for \"my current location.\" This first command is to make sure that any new files and directories created in Kora are assigned the correct permissions in the future. It may not be needed for most cases, but in the few cases where it is, it will be useful. So run the following code: chmod -R g+s . When successful, Terminal will just re-display the command prompt without a message: Next, it is important to confirm that the directories and files in this installation are all set to the 755 permissions level. In the operating system your server is running, this number represents the permissions levels for three different attributes related to a file or directory's ownership in the system. The first number represents the level set for \"Owner,\" the second for \"Group,\" and the third for \"Other/World.\" Setting 7 is full access \u2014 aka read, write, and execute \u2014 whereas setting 5 is read and execute access only. For the purposes of this basic installation, the level for \"Owner\" should always be set to 7 so that you will always be able to make changes to things if needed. However the amount of access given to \"Group\" and \"Other/World\" attributes will affect the security of your server environment, so it is important to set these to 5 or some other non-write setting whenever possible. So, to confirm that the installation's permissions are set at the appropriate levels for the appropriate attributes, run this command to set all of this directory and its contents to \"READ\" (and execute, which is missing from the successful installation message). Again, in many cases it isn't strictly needed, but in the few where it is this will ensure the settings are set correctly: chmod -R 755 . And just as before, when successful, it will just re-display the command prompt without a message. Next it is important to check if your \"Write\" permissions are set properly. Run the ls command with the -l flag. ls is the list command; the -l flag is for listing contents in long-form. The full command is: ls -l The resulting list will look like this: In the long-form list, Terminal will display two account names: first the username of \"Owner,\" then (the one highlighted in the image above) the username of \"Group.\" In the example here, both are set to the same username, which means the \"Owner\" permissions level is applied to \"Group\" as well. In this such case \u2014 where the \"Owner\" and \"Group\" have the same username \u2014 no further permissions changes need to be made to ensure Kora is working properly and you may skip down to \" Create Kora Installation URLs .\" However, if these two are different, then you will need to additionally adjust the \"Write\" permissions for \"Group,\" so please continue to the next section. If you intend to set the \"Write\" permissions because you are sure your specific server environment's defaults will prevent Kora from working properly, then you can prepare for the commands in the next section Set \"Write\" and \"Execute\" Permissions On Certain Directories if Needed via cPanel Terminal As stated in the previous section, the previous commands will have been enough for some users to complete the required permissions setup for their installation. However for others, it will be necessary to specifically change the permissions on the three directory trees noted in the successful installation message. If you are unsure of whether or not your file permissions are properly configured, you can quickly test this by completing the rest of the Kora setup process, then creating a record in your Kora installation that has a file attached to it and uploading that file. If the file upload process works, then your current installation does not need any further permissions adjustments. If it does not work, you will need to re-enter cPanel and re-enter Terminal, which should default to the correct location (the root directory) for this section's instructions. You will need to wait until your Kora installation is completed and properly configured before you can conduct this test, so its instructions are provided in the final section of this page, \" Testing the Installation .\" To set the \"Write\" and \"Execute\" permissions for the relevant directories: Begin by ensuring your current Terminal location is the root directory, represented by a \"~\" in the Terminal prompt to the left of the cursor. If your prompt does not have a \"~\" \u2014 it may instead still display \"kora\" \u2014 change your location upward to relocate to the root. As before, use cd , but this time use .. , which just means 'move up one directory': cd .. If needed, continue to use this command until your Terminal prompt looks like this: Run the following three commands, using the exact locations described in the successful installation message (reproduced here in case you are coming back to Terminal after learning that your installation requires these settings to work). These will set the \"Write\" (and \"Execute\") permissions for \"Group\" correctly. Hit \"Enter\" after each command (i.e. run each on its own). chmod -R 775 kora/bootstrap/cache/ chmod -R 775 kora/storage/ chmod -R 775 kora/public/assets/javascripts/production/ Just as before, when successful, each of these will just re-display the command prompt without a message. After you've run all three, your Terminal will look something like this: Create Kora Installation URLs Next, it is important to have your Kora installation accessible via a web browser and URL. There are two options for doing this: a subdomain or a subdirectory . A subdirectory URL looks like: https://example.org/subdirectory, whereas a subdomain looks like: https://subdomain.example.org. You only need to choose one of these two options for you to do. Find the directions for each below. Subdirectory URL Setup Via cPanel Terminal To set up a subdirectory URL for your Kora installation, you will just have to do a couple more things in Terminal. First you will change your location to be inside of the directory that your main URL is accessible from: in this example case in MSU's Domain of One's Own environment, this is a directory called public_html . But another common name for it is www . Use the following, with whatever name pertains to your version: cd public_html Note If you receive an error that \"public_html\" does not exist, more than likely this is because you skipped over a few previous steps that did not pertain to you and so you are currently still inside of the \"kora\" directory. If this is the case, use cd .. to move upward, and then again try cd public_html . (There is no screenshot for this specifically, but you will know you have successfully changed your directory to public_html \u2014 or the one relevant to your case \u2014 when you see it written to the left of the dollar sign character, inside the brackets.) Setting up the subdirectory for your URL requires using the command ln with the -s flag. ln stands for \"link\" and the -s flag tells the system that the link being created is \"symbolic\". The next part of the command is the location of the Kora installation public directory, relative to your current location. And then the final part is the location of the desired subdirectory that will appear at the end of your site's URL. So in the case of a public_html example, the public directory of the installation files is located one directory up, and then inside of kora . So the command is: ln -s ../kora/public kora After both of these steps, your Terminal window will look something like this: This was the last bit of Terminal required for setup, so you may now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main. It isn't necessary, but if you wish, you can run the command exit to terminate your Terminal connection before navigating back to cPanel Main. To confirm that the symbolic link process worked, you may go back into File Manager and navigate into your publicly-accessible directory, which you were to take note of in Step 2 of \" Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager .\" There, you should find the directory \"kora\" with the black chain-link icon over the folder icon. After completing this step, you will need to additionally configure Kora to enable functionality for a module called mod_rewrite . This is explained in the \" Using mod_rewrite in Kora \" section of the \"Advanced Configuration of Kora\" page. Subdomain URLs If going this route for your URL, you can now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main. Setting up the subdomain option for your URL requires using the \"Subdomains\" tool in cPanel, under the \"Domains\" section. In the Subdomain text box, type what you would like for your URL to begin with, before your site's main URL (remember the example above: https://subdomain.example.org). The selected \"Domain\" will likely default to your main URL, which is correct (in the case where you have multiple URLs available, choose the appropriate one). And the tool will autogenerate content in the \"Document Root\" box after you enter something in the \"Subdomain\" box; delete this autogenerated content and instead enter the directory tree for the public folder of your Kora installation. If you have been using all the same directory names and locations as this guide, then you will enter \"kora/public\" into this box. Then hit create. You can see all of this in this screenshot: Enable Force HTTPS for URL Once you have implemented one of the two methods above, your Kora installation is now reachable via a web browser! But there is one last task you should complete before doing so. Kora is designed to use HTTPS protocol for its URLs. So it is important to set up a Force HTTPS Redirect for your domain, and for the subdomain as well if you have gone that route for your URL. To do this, go to \"Domains\" under the \"Domains\" section in cPanel. For your main domain entry and subdomain entry on the list, click the toggle to turn it on (or ensure it is already toggled on for each). Toggling this setting may not immediately work, with an error displaying that might say, \"You cannot activate HTTPS Redirect because AutoSSL is not currently active for this domain or the SSL certificate is not valid.\" If this happens, wait a moment or two and refresh the page, then try toggling the setting on again. Once completed, return to cPanel Main. Further Configure Kora Once installed In a new tab, navigate to your Kora application's URL. If everything has been done correctly, you should land on the login page for your Kora installation. But keep the cPanel open in another tab because you will need to switch back to it to set up your email at some point. If you successfully reached the Kora login page, Congratulations! Your install is at least partially working! From here you will log into the admin account in order to configure your installation properly, but also to test that your directory permissions settings are working properly. The username is \"admin\" and the password is the one that you copied from Terminal, from the successful installation message. Put in that password to log in and you will land on a page that looks like this: It is highly recommended that you at some point click through the introduction to get a quick tutorial on the basics of using Kora. Once done, click on the menu icon in the top-right to bring out the side-bar menu. Then click on \"Management\" at the bottom and select \"Kora Configuration File\" from the options that appear. This page provides text fields to update much of the information saved in that .env file you briefly edited back in Step 8 of \" Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager .\" Configure reCAPTCHA Note Because this subsection regards setting up an external service, there are no screenshots provided. Kora currently uses reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox Kora uses Google's reCAPTCHA service for anti-robot protections. As you can see on the screenshot above, the configuration file is asking for a \"Recaptcha Private Key\" and \"Recaptcha Public Key\", which you will get from that service. The reCAPTCHA documentation can be found at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha , but to create the keys needed for your site, you will go to https://www.google.com/u/0/recaptcha/admin/ . Google will ask you to log in with a Gmail account. Many academic institutions have contracts with Google for using their tools via an educational arrangement; in the case of MSU, it is possible to give Google's login page an MSU email address, which then redirects to an MSU-related login page. Successfully logging in redirects back to reCAPTCHA under the MSU account. If this option is not available to you, unfortunately you will need a Gmail account to gain access to reCAPTCHA, which is required for completing Kora's installation setup. Once logged in, if this is your first time using reCAPTCHA, it will automatically go to the registration page. However, if you have used reCAPTCHA before, it will take you to a page displaying the information for the first reCAPTCHA key set you created. To create a new set of keys, click on the plus icon in the upper-right to register a new site. Give your new set any label you prefer (a suggestion would be to use your Kora installation URL). As noted above, Kora currently uses reCAPTCHA v2 \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox version, so pick those options. Under \"Domains\", write your main domain (do not include \"http://\", \"https://\", or the subdirectory) and either hit Enter or click the plus sign to add it to the list of approved domains for the set of keys that are about to be generated. As an aside: this functionality means you could conceivably have multiple Kora installations, or even multiple sites that use reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox, all using the same keys. The \"Owners\" section should auto-add your account email, but you can add another if you wish. Be sure to (review and) accept the Terms of Service. The final option is the checkbox for \"Send alerts to owners\", which you may wish to leave enabled so that you receive emailed updates when security issues with your site arise. Finally, click \"Submit\". Once redirected back to the main page, the lighter-blue bar at the top will display the number of sites registered and have a dropdown list for you to select whichever. Obviously if this is the first time setting one up, you will only have one. Ensure the one you intend to use is selected in the dropdown and then click on the gear icon in the upper right to go to the reCAPTCHA \"Settings\" page. Click on the \"reCAPTCHA keys\" dropdown list to display your site and secret keys. Copy the \"site key\" and paste it into your Kora Configuration File page text box titled \"Recaptcha Public Key\"; copy the \"secret key\" and paste it into the text box titled \"Recaptcha Private Key\". If you want to ensure this information is saved before setting up your email, scroll to the bottom of the page and click \"Update Configuration File\". Set Up Server Email and Link It to Kora To set up mail for your Kora install, this guide will explain how to use the email client available through cPanel for your Domain of One's Own account. It is possible to set this up with other email clients, however this basic option is easiest for keeping the installation and email all under the one environment. Return to your tab with cPanel Main. Find \"Email Accounts\" under the \"Email\" section. To set up a Kora-specific email address, click on \"Create\". (You could also use the default email address that has already been generated if you like; if using the default email, skip to Step 4 below.) In the \"Create an Email Account\" box, look at the options available in the \"Domain\" dropdown menu. This will be the portion of the email address after the @ symbol. If using a subdomain URL, you can specify this subdomain here, otherwise your option will be limited to your main URL. After choosing the domain, enter a \"Username\", such as \"admin\" if you use the subdomain option, or \"kora\" if you use the main URL option. Finally, click on Generate in the \"Password\" section to receive a randomly generated password (as you did when setting up your MySQL database). IMPORTANT Just as before, ensure you copy this password and save it someplace safe, because it will be needed for email configuration in Kora. The remaining settings should be set according to your preferences. I will not outline how to link this email account to a mail client because the option to generate an email with just such a guide is provided by cPanel. Once everything is set as you like, click \"Create\", which, as long as you leave the \"Stay on this page...\" option unchecked, will create the address and redirect you back to the list of email addresses. To confirm that your address is working properly, click on \"Check Mail\" next to your new address in the list. Then click \"Open\" on the resulting page. As long as these pages load correctly, your server's email client is working correctly. If they do not \u2014 for instance, MSU's Domain of One's Own accounts currently are not working \u2014 you must contact the administrators of your server to rectify this. Return to your Kora Configuration File page tab. Scrolling down, you will find the text boxes for your email information. Leave \"Mail Host\" with \"localhost\". For \"Mail From Address\", it is best to enter the email address you just created so that the emails user receive appear to come from that account; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\". Set the \"Mail From Name\" to your own preference, such as \"Kora Admin\". The \"Mail User\" setting is how Kora connects with your server's mail client, to actually send the email. So this one must be set to an appropriately-configured email, such as the one just created; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\" again. Finally, paste in the save email password into the last box, \"Mail Password\". Save all of these configurations by clicking \"Update Configuration File\". See all of these settings in this screenshot: Note If your server email is disabled by account administrators \u2014 as is the case for MSU Domain of One's Own accounts \u2014 and you cannot get another server email to successfully work with Kora, it is still possible to do anything that may appear to require the email server working, such as confirming new users, inviting users, or setting passwords. Find instructions for these tasks in the guide for managing Kora user accounts . Admin User Profile Settings The final portion of configuration is for the admin account's profile settings. This section is specific to what is a part of the initial configuration for Kora, but this documentation website also has a more complete guide for user profile settings . To get there to the profile settings page, select the user icon in the upper-right. Then choose \"Edit My Profile.\" On this page, you can change the username and password that were auto-generated when installing Kora in Terminal, however it is probably best to leave these alone. However, it is important to change the default admin email here because it is shown to users at various locations throughout Kora. Change it to either your own professional email address, or if you plan to check the server email account set up before (either through the interface you loaded before, or by forwarding it to an email client), set it to that address. You can also change the displayed admin name, if you wish, as it is also displayed to users in various locations. Finally, should you wish to change the admin account password from what was auto-generated to one you prefer, you can do that here. Once all these have been set, click \"Update Profile\" to complete your setup. Testing the Installation To check whether or not your installation works properly: Create a Project . Create a Form in that project. Create a Field in that project with the field type set to one of the File types (setting it to \"Documents\" will give the greatest flexibility for uploading any file to test). And finally, create a Record where you upload an example file. If the creation of that Record with an uploaded file succeeds, such that the uploaded file is viewable or downloadable when clicked upon, then your permissions are correct. If this fails, please go to \" Set 'Write' and 'Execute' Privileges On Certain Directories if Needed via cPanel Terminal \" above. Follow the instructions there for using cPanel Terminal to adjust your Kora installation's permissions on the correct directories.","title":"Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own & Reclaim Hosting"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#installing-kora-on-domain-of-ones-own-and-reclaim-hosting","text":"This is a basic guide for installing Kora in a Reclaim Hosting -based server environment, which includes any Domain of One's Own services offered by institutions. A few things about this guide. First, in many cases of naming something or writing Terminal commands, things will be case sensitive, so unless the specific instance requires uppercase for something, this guide will always use lowercase and its author strongly suggests you do the same. Keeping things all lowercase is a good thing to follow for best practices because it removes any doubt or confusion over whether some file, directory, or URL should have uppercase letters in it. Second, a note about terminology. To keep things consistent, this guide will be using the word \"directory\" and its derivatives throughout this guide, rather than \"folder\" in order to better illuminate the link between URL and file structure throughout this process. Finally, make sure to visit the Kora GitHub repo releases to download the zip file containing the most recent Kora release.","title":"Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own and Reclaim Hosting"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#log-in-to-cpanel","text":"Begin all of this by logging into your account to reach your cPanel.

Start by finding the section called \"Databases\" and clicking on \"MySQL Databases\". Under \"Create new Database,\" enter \"kora\" or some other name in the text field and click \"Create Database.\" Take note of the auto-generated prefix, which, when combined with whatever you just provided, will be the name of your MySQL database. In this example case it is called geyerbri_kora . Once you've noted this database name, click on the link to take you back to the previous page. Next, scroll down to \"MySQL Users\" and provide the username \"kora\" in the text box under \"Add New User\". This is a common practice \u2014 the database and the default user for that database having the same name \u2014 which will make it easier to update configurations elsewhere. After this, click on the button \"Password Generator.\" The Password Generator modal will open and generate a random string of characters (blocked out in the image below). IMPORTANT Copy this password to somewhere for safe-keeping. You will need it later for configuration of your Kora installation. After copying this password to somewhere, click \"Use Password.\" When the modal closes, the generated password will auto-fill into the \"Add New User\" section and it should rate the password as \"Very Strong.\" Click on \"Create User\" to complete this process. Just as you did with the database name, take note of this username, as you will need it for Kora configuration elsewhere. Because this guide follows the common practice of using the same name for the database and user, this example username is also geyerbri_kora . Click the back link to get back to the previous page. The final step in setting up the required MySQL database is to assign the newly-created user to the newly-created database and give that user full permissions. Do this by first scrolling down to \"Add User To Database\", confirming that the names are correctly chosen, and clicking on \"Add.\" The page that opens will provide a list of permissions that can be assigned to the chosen user for the specified database. Click the checkbox for \"ALL PRIVILEGES.\" Scroll down if needed to find the \"Make Changes\" box. Clicking on it will generate an in-page notification that it was successful. Click on the \"Go Back\" link to get back to the main \"MySQL Databases\" page. To confirm that you have successfully created the database, created the user, and added the user to the database, find the section \"Current Databases\" and check that there is an entry for your new database, with your new user listed as a privileged user.","title":"Set up MySQL Database"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#return-to-cpanel-main","text":"To return from nearly any part of cPanel to the Main interface (shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this guide), you can click on the grid icon in the upper-left.","title":"Return to cPanel Main"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#upload-and-prepare-kora-application-files-via-cpanel-file-manager","text":"From cPanel Main, find the section \"Files\" and click on \"File Manager.\" Take a note of which directory is your main URL directory (the one that provides all the files available via your main URL). In this screenshot you can see the globe icon being used for the URL directory \"public_html,\" which is the common icon in this version of cPanel and used in MSU's Domain of One's Own. You may use this directory later, to confirm something in Step 3 of \"Subdirectory URL Setup Via cPanel Terminal,\" if following that path for creating your Kora installation URL (this will make sense later). You will also notice the same globe icon, but with a black chain-link icon over it, used for \"www\". This is something different, which will be explained in one of the sections about setting up the installation URL below. But for now just know that the directory with the globe and without the chain-link is the one you need to make note of. In order to properly view all the relevant Kora installation files once they have been created, it is important for you to make all the hidden files visible. To do this, go to the File Manager's \"Settings\" by clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right. Click the checkbox for \"Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)\" and then click \"Save\". Next, you'll upload the Kora installation .zip file you downloaded earlier from Kora's GitHub repo releases page. Kora is intended to be installed outside of the main URL directory you noted in Step 2 of this section, to keep it secure and reduce any chances of interference with any other website content you have in your server environment; the easiest is to install it into the same directory alongside your main URL directory. If you have never changed the default directory that loads when opening File Manager, you should be viewing the correct location, which in this example case is named after the user (\"geyerbri\"). While at this location, click on \"Upload\" in the menu at the top. In the page that opens, just drag-and-drop the .zip file to upload it. You may also click on \"Select File\" to find it via your computer's file management windows. When the .zip file finishes uploading, click on the link leading back to File Manager. Locate the uploaded .zip file in this directory, right-click it to bring up the context menu, and select \"Extract.\" In the Extract modal that opens, leave the default location alone (the text box is likely blank) and click \"Extract File(s).\" In the follow-up modal called \"Extraction Results,\" click \"Close.\" Extracting the .zip file will create a new directory, which is likely called \"kora-XXX,\" with the version number in the placeholder. Locate this directory, right-click on it, and select \"Rename.\" In the Rename modal that opens, change the text in the box to \"kora\" (without quotations) and click \"Rename File.\" Next, it's time to initially set up the .env file that manages some of the configuration settings for your Kora install. Many of the settings in this file will be adjustable once the installation is complete, but a few are not and require configuration now. Enter/access your renamed \"kora\" directory by double clicking on it, then right-click on the \".env.example\" file and select \"Copy.\" In the Copy modal that opens, add \"/.env\" without quotations to whatever is already in the text box and click \"Copy File(s).\" Once the file has been renamed, select it and then click on \"Edit\" in the menu at the top. The Edit modal that opens provides a warning to back up the file you are about to edit before making any changes. This is always a good practice to follow, so that any mistakes can be quickly and easily rectified. Luckily, since the file you are about to edit is a direct copy of \".env.example,\" you already have a backed-up copy of its current state, so in this case making an additional backup is not necessary. So go ahead and click on \"Edit.\" A new tab will open with the editor. Here, change lines 6, 7, and 8 to match the info you saved about your MySQL database. For example, given the info previously saved from the database setup before, this guide's example code would look like: DB_DATABASE=geyerbri_kora DB_USERNAME=geyerbri_kora DB_PASSWORD={saved database user password} Notice, this is where you will paste in the database password you saved in Step 5 of \" Set Up MySQL Database \" above. Remove the curl brackets from the example code and make sure there are no spaces before or after the password. After finishing this, click \"Save Changes\". Once that's done you can either close the tab or click \"Close\" (which does the same thing) and go back to the File Manager tab. Finally, there is one more example file to copy as a configuration file. Enter the directory \"public\" and also copy the file \".htaccess.example\". Add \"/.htaccess\" after the defaulted location, the same way you did for \".env\" in the previous step. The default settings in this file will work for basic installations of Kora, but should you want to adjust settings such as more complex URLs than what this guide presents (see \" Create Kora Installation URLs \" below), or to change the advanced settings such as acceptable file sizes, memory limits, timeout lengths, etc., they are controlled in this file. Once copied, you're finished with the initial file setup. Navigate back to cPanel Main.","title":"Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#kora-installation-and-initial-configuration-via-cpanel-terminal","text":"In cPanel Main, scroll down to the section called \"Advanced\" and open \"Terminal.\" Read and (hopefully) accept the terms to reach the in-cPanel Terminal interface. It will look like this: In Terminal, you will be using some basic commands to move around and change a few things. The first one is cd , which just changes your location in the file system. Change your directory to whichever directory you just renamed the extracted zip file to. If you've been using the suggested names above, this will be \"kora\": cd kora Next, run the installation process: php artisan kora:install Before running this last command, the window will look like this: After running, if it is successful, the window will look like this, with the successful installation message (in green): Note If the installation fails and provides a message that says (in part) \"Failed to connect to database! Check your database credentials or review the logs for more error information,\" this may be due to some common problems and there are a few things to check before trying to run the installation command again. First, return to the MySQL section of cPanel to confirm you have written down the full database name and username correctly. Second, re-open the .env file where you earlier put that database information, to double-check that these names are correct. If they are, there may be an issue with the generated password for your MySQL user. You can go generate a new password, save it again, and enter it into the .env file, before once again trying to run the installation command. If the installation again fails, the issue may be something else. You can check for any similar issues and potential solutions in Kora's GitHub Issues , or open your own Issue with a detailed description of the problem. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT : You must copy the last line generated here in the successful installation message (outlined above), which has your password for the generated username of \"admin\". To copy things in cPanel's Terminal, first use your mouse to select the line, then right-click and select \"Copy.\" Paste this somewhere safe, where you will not lose it! Warning It cannot be stressed enough how important this step is, because losing this password means losing access to your installation and will require a full reinstallation. Notice that, in the successful installation message, you are directed to \"give READ access to the web user,\" as well as \"WRITE access\" for specific directories, to ensure that Kora continues functioning properly after users start contributing. What these directions require could be different for different Domain of One's Own environments, because different system administrators may have set up the default permissions for the environment differently. For now, to ensure that things are set up for the most likely scenario for most Domain of One's Own or Reclaim Hosting environments, you will be setting file permissions for the entire \"kora\" directory and its contents. Because these commands have to be applied to all the files and directories within, you will have to do this here, via Terminal, using the chmod command and the -R flag. chmod stands for \"change mode,\" which is how the server's operating system refers to changing permissions. The -R flag tells the command to run recursively, i.e. change them for this directory and everything it contains. Finally, the . is the short-hand for \"my current location.\" This first command is to make sure that any new files and directories created in Kora are assigned the correct permissions in the future. It may not be needed for most cases, but in the few cases where it is, it will be useful. So run the following code: chmod -R g+s . When successful, Terminal will just re-display the command prompt without a message: Next, it is important to confirm that the directories and files in this installation are all set to the 755 permissions level. In the operating system your server is running, this number represents the permissions levels for three different attributes related to a file or directory's ownership in the system. The first number represents the level set for \"Owner,\" the second for \"Group,\" and the third for \"Other/World.\" Setting 7 is full access \u2014 aka read, write, and execute \u2014 whereas setting 5 is read and execute access only. For the purposes of this basic installation, the level for \"Owner\" should always be set to 7 so that you will always be able to make changes to things if needed. However the amount of access given to \"Group\" and \"Other/World\" attributes will affect the security of your server environment, so it is important to set these to 5 or some other non-write setting whenever possible. So, to confirm that the installation's permissions are set at the appropriate levels for the appropriate attributes, run this command to set all of this directory and its contents to \"READ\" (and execute, which is missing from the successful installation message). Again, in many cases it isn't strictly needed, but in the few where it is this will ensure the settings are set correctly: chmod -R 755 . And just as before, when successful, it will just re-display the command prompt without a message. Next it is important to check if your \"Write\" permissions are set properly. Run the ls command with the -l flag. ls is the list command; the -l flag is for listing contents in long-form. The full command is: ls -l The resulting list will look like this: In the long-form list, Terminal will display two account names: first the username of \"Owner,\" then (the one highlighted in the image above) the username of \"Group.\" In the example here, both are set to the same username, which means the \"Owner\" permissions level is applied to \"Group\" as well. In this such case \u2014 where the \"Owner\" and \"Group\" have the same username \u2014 no further permissions changes need to be made to ensure Kora is working properly and you may skip down to \" Create Kora Installation URLs .\" However, if these two are different, then you will need to additionally adjust the \"Write\" permissions for \"Group,\" so please continue to the next section. If you intend to set the \"Write\" permissions because you are sure your specific server environment's defaults will prevent Kora from working properly, then you can prepare for the commands in the next section","title":"Kora Installation and Initial Configuration via cPanel Terminal"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#set-write-and-execute-permissions-on-certain-directories-if-needed-via-cpanel-terminal","text":"As stated in the previous section, the previous commands will have been enough for some users to complete the required permissions setup for their installation. However for others, it will be necessary to specifically change the permissions on the three directory trees noted in the successful installation message. If you are unsure of whether or not your file permissions are properly configured, you can quickly test this by completing the rest of the Kora setup process, then creating a record in your Kora installation that has a file attached to it and uploading that file. If the file upload process works, then your current installation does not need any further permissions adjustments. If it does not work, you will need to re-enter cPanel and re-enter Terminal, which should default to the correct location (the root directory) for this section's instructions. You will need to wait until your Kora installation is completed and properly configured before you can conduct this test, so its instructions are provided in the final section of this page, \" Testing the Installation .\" To set the \"Write\" and \"Execute\" permissions for the relevant directories: Begin by ensuring your current Terminal location is the root directory, represented by a \"~\" in the Terminal prompt to the left of the cursor. If your prompt does not have a \"~\" \u2014 it may instead still display \"kora\" \u2014 change your location upward to relocate to the root. As before, use cd , but this time use .. , which just means 'move up one directory': cd .. If needed, continue to use this command until your Terminal prompt looks like this: Run the following three commands, using the exact locations described in the successful installation message (reproduced here in case you are coming back to Terminal after learning that your installation requires these settings to work). These will set the \"Write\" (and \"Execute\") permissions for \"Group\" correctly. Hit \"Enter\" after each command (i.e. run each on its own). chmod -R 775 kora/bootstrap/cache/ chmod -R 775 kora/storage/ chmod -R 775 kora/public/assets/javascripts/production/ Just as before, when successful, each of these will just re-display the command prompt without a message.

There are two options for doing this: a subdomain or a subdirectory . A subdirectory URL looks like: https://example.org/subdirectory, whereas a subdomain looks like: https://subdomain.example.org.

First you will change your location to be inside of the directory that your main URL is accessible from: in this example case in MSU's Domain of One's Own environment, this is a directory called public_html . But another common name for it is www . Use the following, with whatever name pertains to your version: cd public_html Note If you receive an error that \"public_html\" does not exist, more than likely this is because you skipped over a few previous steps that did not pertain to you and so you are currently still inside of the \"kora\" directory. If this is the case, use cd .. to move upward, and then again try cd public_html . (There is no screenshot for this specifically, but you will know you have successfully changed your directory to public_html \u2014 or the one relevant to your case \u2014 when you see it written to the left of the dollar sign character, inside the brackets.) Setting up the subdirectory for your URL requires using the command ln with the -s flag. ln stands for \"link\" and the -s flag tells the system that the link being created is \"symbolic\". The next part of the command is the location of the Kora installation public directory, relative to your current location. And then the final part is the location of the desired subdirectory that will appear at the end of your site's URL. So in the case of a public_html example, the public directory of the installation files is located one directory up, and then inside of kora . So the command is: ln -s ../kora/public kora After both of these steps, your Terminal window will look something like this: This was the last bit of Terminal required for setup, so you may now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main. It isn't necessary, but if you wish, you can run the command exit to terminate your Terminal connection before navigating back to cPanel Main. To confirm that the symbolic link process worked, you may go back into File Manager and navigate into your publicly-accessible directory, which you were to take note of in Step 2 of \" Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager .\" There, you should find the directory \"kora\" with the black chain-link icon over the folder icon.

The reCAPTCHA documentation can be found at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha , but to create the keys needed for your site, you will go to https://www.google.com/u/0/recaptcha/admin/ . Google will ask you to log in with a Gmail account. Many academic institutions have contracts with Google for using their tools via an educational arrangement; in the case of MSU, it is possible to give Google's login page an MSU email address, which then redirects to an MSU-related login page. Successfully logging in redirects back to reCAPTCHA under the MSU account. If this option is not available to you, unfortunately you will need a Gmail account to gain access to reCAPTCHA, which is required for completing Kora's installation setup. Once logged in, if this is your first time using reCAPTCHA, it will automatically go to the registration page. However, if you have used reCAPTCHA before, it will take you to a page displaying the information for the first reCAPTCHA key set you created. To create a new set of keys, click on the plus icon in the upper-right to register a new site. Give your new set any label you prefer (a suggestion would be to use your Kora installation URL).

If using a subdomain URL, you can specify this subdomain here, otherwise your option will be limited to your main URL. After choosing the domain, enter a \"Username\", such as \"admin\" if you use the subdomain option, or \"kora\" if you use the main URL option. Finally, click on Generate in the \"Password\" section to receive a randomly generated password (as you did when setting up your MySQL database). IMPORTANT Just as before, ensure you copy this password and save it someplace safe, because it will be needed for email configuration in Kora.

LAMP stands for: Linux Operating System Apache (Version 2.0) MySQL (Version 5.7.20) PHP (Version 7.1.3 to 7.2.31) These versions are Kora's minimum version requirements. Oftentimes, the server environment will rely on minor variations of these. For instance, the httpd (or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) version of Apache 2 is often used. Use whichever installer is available for your Linux-based environment to install \u2014 or confirm installation of \u2014 the most recent versions of these basic applications in your Linux server environment. Common installers include apt (Advanced Package Tool) and yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modifier). PHP Packages After confirming the environment is a LAMP Stack with the appropriate version levels for MySQL and PHP, it will be important to install several additional PHP packages. These are: php-common php-mysql php-xml php-xmlrpc php-curl php-gd php-imagick php-cli php-dev php-imap php-mbstring php-opcache php-soap php-zip php-intl Install the versions of these packages that correspond to the version of PHP you have installed as a part of your LAMP Stack. If other issues arise, it may be that some other PHP modules not included in the core PHP installation or packages listed above are also required. Kora is build on the Laravel PHP Framework, so it is possible one of its required PHP modules is missing from your server environment and so the culprit. Enabling mod_rewrite Kora is designed to have only its \"public\" folder accessible online. To accomplish this, it uses an Apache module called mod_rewrite to manage internet browser navigation within the installation, via the \".htaccess\" file inside the \"public\" directory. Different servers handle enabling and disabling mod_rewrite in different ways, so it will be important for you to find out how this is managed with your specific circumstance and then confirm that mod_rewrite is enabled for the domain where Kora is accessed. This sometimes requires finding the \".conf\" file for your version of Apache, which contains the overarching permissions for, among many modules, mod_rewrite . Determining where this \".conf\" file is saved is sometimes possible by temporarily creating a webpage on your domain that provides a full readout of your PHP configuration. Create a file named \"server-readout.php\" in the root directory for your domain; this is often named \"html\", \"public\", or \"www\". Further, it is often also the inner-most of these directories; this means, if the directory \"www\" exists, but inside this is a subdirectory named \"html\", the root directory is most likely \"html\". Inside the created file, put the single line: <?php phpinfo(); ?> To do this via an SSH Terminal connection instead, navigate to the domain root (again, often named \"html\", or \"public\", or \"www\") and then use the following command to create this file with the same contents: echo \"<?php phpinfo(); ?>\" > server-readout.php Once created, you can navigate to this file in your brower: http(s)://your.domain.name/server-readout.php. This page has a ton of sensitive information, so you should not leave it up for long. It has a banner similar to this at the top: Scrolling down to the section called \"apache2handler\" or similar, you will find the apache root directory \u2014 which will contain the relevant \".conf\" file \u2014 as well as confirmation that mod_rewrite is loaded generally as a module, as noted in this screenshot: If the mod_rewrite module is not loaded, use the version of apache your environment is running to search for case specific instructions on how to load it. For instance, for an environment using a generic version of apache, you might run the following commands one at a time: sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo service apache2 restart Each of these commands uses sudo , which tells the linux system to run the command as a super user (it's an acronym for \"super user do\"). It is necessary to also restart apache, in order for the change to take effect. To ensure your \".conf\" file is properly configured to allow mod_rewrite to function properly in \".htaccess\" files, you will next need to navigate to the aforementioned apache root directory. Inside you will find a directory, likely named either \"httpd\" or \"apache\"; inside of this directory will be the relevant \".conf\" file. In the case of an environment using \"httpd\", this file will be named \"httpd.conf\". Edit this file. If using SSH or Terminal, open the file for editing by using the nano text editor that comes built in: sudo nano httpd.conf and scroll through, looking for a section that looks something similar to: <Directory \"/var/www/html\"> AllowOverride None # Allow open access: Require all granted </Directory> In this case, the root directory fo this domain is inside \"html\", which is inside \"www\", which is itself inside \"var\", so in this example the relevant code in the .conf file is for /var/www/html . In other cases the relevant code will correspond to some other directory. In this example, note how AllowOverride is set to None ; to allow mod_rewrite to work properly, change AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All : <Directory \"/var/www/html\"> AllowOverride All # Allow open access: Require all granted </Directory> Save this change; if using SSH or Terminal, do this by exiting with the key combination \"ctrl + x\", and then hitting \"y\" to agree to saving the file. It will ask for the file name to be saved, but default to the file's current name, which is what you'll want. Hit \"enter\" to save and exit nano. After adjusting this file, restart your apache. Once again, if yours is the generic version, use: sudo service apache2 restart Once finished, mod_overwrite will be enabled for your root directory. Important: Remember to delete the .php page you created, containing your server information. This can be done via SSH or Terminal, when located in its directory, with the command: rm server-readout.php HTTPS and SSL Certificate Kora requires the HTTPS protocol to be enabled for the domain in which it is accessible, which requires an SSL certificate. For some server environments, the included interface \u2014 such as cPanel \u2014 will have a section for managing the process of enabling HTTPS and acquiring/associating an SSL certificate as a part of that process. Sometimes \u2014 such as with MSU's Domains of One's Own accounts and their corresponding cPanel \u2014 the SSL certificate and its renewal are handled behind-the-scenes, so to speak, and the certificate is acquired/associated when the HTTPS protocol option is enabled. In other instances, it will be necessary to apply for an SSL certificate. This can be done in a number of ways, but the one most commonly used as a cost-free method is through a server application called Certbot , which manages the application, acquisition, and association of an SSL certificate from a free certificate supplier called Let's Encrypt . Certbot is a great option for those who need to go this route because it can also be configured to handle automatic certification renewals, since SSL certificates expire. One possible way to install certbot into your server environment is from Certbot directly, and then to provide \"Execute\" permissions. wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto chmod a+x certbot-auto The specifics of using certbot will depend upon your domain, email address, etc. so it wouldn't be possible to provide a guide here. Certbot provides some more-granular instructions for use on their \"Instructions\" page , which should be enough to get the SSL certificate needed. Google reCAPTCHA Kora requires integration with Google's reCAPTCHA verification service. Instructions for how to implement this can be found in the Reclaim Hosting/Domain of One's Own installation guide . Kora Email Kora requires a Simple Mail transfer Protocol (SMTP) email server for sending emails related to new user sign-ups, invitations, or lost passwords. In some cases, the email server will be handled by some part of the included interface \u2014 including in many cPanel-based interfaces \u2014 but in others the email server may be managed via the SSH connection to the environment. When configuring Kora's email settings, it is possible to use an SMTP server on another domain, by providing the appropriate domain name for the server for \"Mail Host,\" appropriate user email address from that server for \"Mail User,\" and the email address's password in \"Mail Password.\" Please see Step 5 of \" Set Up Server Email and Link It to Kora .\" Additionally, if the \"Mail User\" and \"Mail From Address\" do not match, the recipient's mail client is more likely to flag the generated email as spam. In the case of MSU's Domains of one's Own, emails have been entirely disabled to comply with a univeristy-wide policy. If you are unable to set up an SMTP server to use with your Kora installation \u2014 such as on another, privately-managed domain \u2014 you will need to manage user creation and password resets manually. To do this, please consult the guide for manually managing Kora user accounts .","title":"System Requirements"},{"location":"getting-started/system_requirements/#system-requirements","text":"Kora requires a server environment with at least 1 GB of storage and 1 GB of RAM, deployed with what is referred to as a LAMP Stack.

For instance, for an environment using a generic version of apache, you might run the following commands one at a time: sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo service apache2 restart Each of these commands uses sudo , which tells the linux system to run the command as a super user (it's an acronym for \"super user do\"). It is necessary to also restart apache, in order for the change to take effect. To ensure your \".conf\" file is properly configured to allow mod_rewrite to function properly in \".htaccess\" files, you will next need to navigate to the aforementioned apache root directory. Inside you will find a directory, likely named either \"httpd\" or \"apache\"; inside of this directory will be the relevant \".conf\" file. In the case of an environment using \"httpd\", this file will be named \"httpd.conf\". Edit this file. If using SSH or Terminal, open the file for editing by using the nano text editor that comes built in: sudo nano httpd.conf and scroll through, looking for a section that looks something similar to: <Directory \"/var/www/html\"> AllowOverride None # Allow open access: Require all granted </Directory> In this case, the root directory fo this domain is inside \"html\", which is inside \"www\", which is itself inside \"var\", so in this example the relevant code in the .conf file is for /var/www/html . In other cases the relevant code will correspond to some other directory. In this example, note how AllowOverride is set to None ; to allow mod_rewrite to work properly, change AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All : <Directory \"/var/www/html\"> AllowOverride All # Allow open access: Require all granted </Directory> Save this change; if using SSH or Terminal, do this by exiting with the key combination \"ctrl + x\", and then hitting \"y\" to agree to saving the file. It will ask for the file name to be saved, but default to the file's current name, which is what you'll want. Hit \"enter\" to save and exit nano. After adjusting this file, restart your apache. Once again, if yours is the generic version, use: sudo service apache2 restart Once finished, mod_overwrite will be enabled for your root directory. Important: Remember to delete the .php page you created, containing your server information. This can be done via SSH or Terminal, when located in its directory, with the command: rm server-readout.php","title":"Enabling mod_rewrite"},{"location":"getting-started/system_requirements/#https-and-ssl-certificate","text":"Kora requires the HTTPS protocol to be enabled for the domain in which it is accessible, which requires an SSL certificate. For some server environments, the included interface \u2014 such as cPanel \u2014 will have a section for managing the process of enabling HTTPS and acquiring/associating an SSL certificate as a part of that process. Sometimes \u2014 such as with MSU's Domains of One's Own accounts and their corresponding cPanel \u2014 the SSL certificate and its renewal are handled behind-the-scenes, so to speak, and the certificate is acquired/associated when the HTTPS protocol option is enabled. In other instances, it will be necessary to apply for an SSL certificate. This can be done in a number of ways, but the one most commonly used as a cost-free method is through a server application called Certbot , which manages the application, acquisition, and association of an SSL certificate from a free certificate supplier called Let's Encrypt . Certbot is a great option for those who need to go this route because it can also be configured to handle automatic certification renewals, since SSL certificates expire. One possible way to install certbot into your server environment is from Certbot directly, and then to provide \"Execute\" permissions. wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto chmod a+x certbot-auto The specifics of using certbot will depend upon your domain, email address, etc. so it wouldn't be possible to provide a guide here. Certbot provides some more-granular instructions for use on their \"Instructions\" page , which should be enough to get the SSL certificate needed.","title":"HTTPS and SSL Certificate"},{"location":"getting-started/system_requirements/#google-recaptcha","text":"Kora requires integration with Google's reCAPTCHA verification service.

In some cases, the email server will be handled by some part of the included interface \u2014 including in many cPanel-based interfaces \u2014 but in others the email server may be managed via the SSH connection to the environment. When configuring Kora's email settings, it is possible to use an SMTP server on another domain, by providing the appropriate domain name for the server for \"Mail Host,\" appropriate user email address from that server for \"Mail User,\" and the email address's password in \"Mail Password.\" Please see Step 5 of \" Set Up Server Email and Link It to Kora .\" Additionally, if the \"Mail User\" and \"Mail From Address\" do not match, the recipient's mail client is more likely to flag the generated email as spam. In the case of MSU's Domains of one's Own, emails have been entirely disabled to comply with a univeristy-wide policy. If you are unable to set up an SMTP server to use with your Kora installation \u2014 such as on another, privately-managed domain \u2014 you will need to manage user creation and password resets manually.

Kora takes a somewhat unique approach to user types and permissions. Instead of having a variety of user types, each with their own fixed array of permissions, Kora (mostly) uses a group model. Basically, a permission group in Kora is a bucket to which a Kora admin assigns permissions (called group permissions). Any user can be placed in a permission group, thereby inhereting the permissions of the group. The point of this model is to provide maximum flexibility for user management. A Kora admin could create a permission group that only allows users to view records, while another permission group could allow users to view and edit records. There are two types of permission groups: Project Groups and Form Groups . Each group type has slighlty different options (more on that below) given that what you can do in a Kora project is different from what you can do in a Kora form. Beyond permission groups, there are three fixed user types: Kora Admin , Project Admin , and Form Admin . Kora Admin A Kora admin sits on top of the user pyramid. They have access to all projects in a Kora install, and have unique management privaledges such as: creating, editing, deleting projects; importing and exporting projects; configuring a Kora install; managing all users in a Kora install; and managing Kora tokens and API requests. In addition, they have all of the privaledges of all other user types and permission groups. Basically, a Kora admin can do anythign in a Kora install. While all new Kora installs require at least one admin, you (as an admin) can create any number of other admin accounts. Project Admin Similar to the Kora Admin, the Project Admin sits at the top of the user pyramid within a project . While they can't create new projects, they pretty much can do anything within the project for which they are an admin. This includes creating forms, editing forms, deleting forms, creating field value presets, importing and exporting forms, and managing user permissions. They also have the permissions of all of the user and permission groups below them. Form Admin Similar to Kora Admins and Peoject Admins, a Form Admin is the top level user within a form . While they can't create new forms, they have pretty much all other permissions within the form for which they are an admin. This includes managing form permissions, managing associator permissions (managing what forms are alowed to associte to other forms), importing and export records, delete records, delete all records, delete old record files (deleting files that belong to a reord that no longer exists), managing record presets, managing revisions, creating and editing fields, creating and editing records, deleting records, and modifying form layouts. Project Group As their name suggests, Project Groups exist on the project level, and control permissions of users within a single project. Project groups have three options that can be turned on or off: Create Forms, Edit Forms, Delete Forms. By default, when a new project is created in Kora, there are two permission groups: Admin Group and Default Group . The Admin Group has all three abovementioned options turned on. The Default Group, on the other hand, doesn't have any of the options turned on. Project Admins can, of course, change the options for the two default permission groups, or create any number of new ones they want. Need to learn how to add/remove users within a project? Visit the Adding Users to Projects guide. Form Groups As their name suggests, Form Groups exist on the form level. They control the permissions of users within a single form. Form Groups have 6 options that can be turned on or off: Create Field, Edit Field, Delete Field, Create Record, Edit Record, and Delete Record. When a new form is created, two default permission groups are created: Admin Group and Default Group. The Admin Group has all of the aforementioned options turned on, while the Default has all of them turned off. A Form Admin (or a Project Admin or Kora Admin, for that matter) can modify these as they see fit, or create any number of new Form Groups as they need.

It is generated by entering information into fields within a form . Forms and fields provide the framework in which to enter data, with the resulting records becoming the substance of your repository. To begin creating a record, you must first choose the project that you want to enter records into. Then select the form you would like to enter a record into by clicking on that form's name. Then follow these steps to create a record: To start creating a record, there are two options: One option is to click the Create New Record button on the form home page or you can click the form name in the menu bar to open the dropdown and choose the Create New Record option. alternatively, you may also select Create New Record from the dropdown menu made available by clicking on the form name in the menu bar. This will open a New Record page. Now you can fill out the various fields you have created within the form with your data. All the fields with a green dot next to it are a required field and will have to be filled out. This can only be changed by editing the required field If your form has multiple pages, you can toggle between them using the buttons Previous Page and Next Page at the bottom of the screen. When you are finished entering the information for the record, click Create New Record . Note: When you are uploading any files, there are some restrictions on filenames. They are limited to a-z , A-Z , 0-9 , . , - and _ . No spaces are permitted in filenames. Also, when creating list items, if your item contains any commas you must encapsulate the entire list item within quotation marks. Additional Information This section describes additional information that may be useful when creating a record. This includes how to use a record preset, how to duplicate records and how to create a record preset. Using a Record Preset Record presets use a previously created record to fill in a new record with the same values. This is useful when you have records that will use the same data for multiple fields. If you would like to use a record preset, click the circle for the Use a Record Preset option in a New Record page. This will provide a new dropdown option to select a record preset. The new record will then have its fields filled in with the same values as the selected record present. You are still able to edit the newly filled in fields after the preset is selected. Duplicate Record You may also select the Duplicate Record option from the New Record page. If you chose to duplicate your record, an identical copy of the record will be created. You can set the number of duplicates after selecting the option. You may also duplicate a record after it has been created. Simply search or browse for the record you would like to duplicate and select the Duplicate Records option at the bottom of the block for that record.

Rather than performing multiple imports to submit records into different forms, you may perform one multiform record import. This will require formatting your records in a particular way in a slightly different process from importing records into a single form . These records must be formatted into csv, json or xml files. Examples of the correct file formats are provided in the File Formatting section below. Navigating to the Import Page Navigating to Import Multi Form Records page can take place from either the dashboard or from a project's homepage. Either of these options will bring you to the Import Multi Form Records page where you can import multiple record files to multiple forms. Navigating from the Dashboard From the dashboard, you are able to navigate to the Import Multi Form Records page from a project block by clicking on the Quick Action icon. Navigating from your Project Homepage Alternatively, you may select Import MF Record Setup from the project homepage using the Kora menu. Preparing the Data Before you begin importing multiple records into multiple forms, you will have to prepare your data in a way that Kora will be able to understand. In order to make this process easier take the following into consideration for your data: Each form should have its own file containg records . For example, Form 1 will get a file containing all records for Form 1, while Form 2 will import a file containing all records for Form 2. Every single field column and datatype within an imported file should conform to the Kora datatype standard . These fields and data types can be found in the file formats section below. The names of the field types in the example files below will be replaced with the names of your field. For example, if you have a text field named \"field 1\", then \"text field\":\"Your text value\" will be changed to \"field 1\":\"Your text value\". Make sure that your associator Fileds are labled correclty . See the next section for details. Multi-field field types have to be imported as XML or JSON (not CSV) . A multi-field field, such as a combo list field , contains other fields within it. There is no way to format this using CSV, and records containing such a field must be formatted using XML or JSON. All attached files should be compressed into a zip file . If your imported records contain images or other files, then those files must be compressed into a zip file. If the files are within folders in that zip file, then the directory path must be included with the file/sheet of records in order for the connection to be made. An example of a call to a file is provided: Associatiors Associators are a useful field type that allow you to create associations between records. Correctly formatting Associator field columns will allow you to create associations with other imported records and records currently in Kora. To make sure that all of your records are associated correclty, consider the following: * The \"Associator\" field column will contain the name of the associator field for this record. Providing Kora IDs or \"kidConnection\" identifiers will create associations with those records in this associator field. * The \"reverseAssociations\" field column will allow you to create associations in other records that point towards this record. Other record's associators will therefore point towards this record. You will need the name of the associator field as well as the KID of the records that you want to to point to that record. * The \"kidConnection\" field column allows you to create a temporary identifier for an imported record. This is necessary since an imported record does not yet have a KID. This will allow associators to point towards an imported record by putting its \"kidConnection\" identifier in either the \"Associator\" or \"reverseAssociations\" field column. File Formats The files in this section provide the data structure that your imported records will have to conform to. Data not structured as in the files below will be unreadable to Kora. There are three formats that you are able to upload files: 1) .csv, 2) .json, and 3) .xml. Below you can view and download example files for each file type. CSV Format This file format uses Comma Separated Values to describe the fields you are attempting to import. CSVs are commonlly created in Microsoft Excel. You can go to the bottom of this section to download an example CSV file or use the following steps to start a new CSV file: In Excel go to the File menu and click Save As Identify a filename and location Select File Format: CSV UTF-8. Click Save You will see the following prompt: \u201cThis workbook cannot be saved in the selected file format because it contains multiple sheets. To save the entire workbook, click Cancel, and then save the workbook in another format. To keep the selected format and save only the active sheet\". Click OK . Then you'll see the following prompt: \"Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv). Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)\u201d. Click Yes . Close the spread sheet.This file can now be used to create additional csv files and to add your records in. Note : Do not edit csv files in Microsoft Excel and do a regular save. This could potentially add extra Microsoft stuff into your file. Instead it is recommended to edit csv files only in a text editor such as Atom or Notepad++. Note : It is also reccomended that you open every single csv file in a text editor and do a general check. Especially check for: blank rows at the end of each document and the continued presence of special characters/diacritics ( make sure the file is UTF-8 encoded ). An example of the CSV format is embedded below. Follow the import_example_csv.csv link to github.com in order to download this file. JSON Format The JSON file format uses JavaScript Object Notation to describe the fields for the records you are attempting to import. You will need a text editor to create and edit JSON files. An example of the JSON format is embedded below. Follow the import_example_json.json link to github.com in order to download this file. XML Format The XML file format stands for Extensible Markup Language . It is a markup language designed to encode data that is both machine and human readable. You will need a text editor to create and edit XML files. An example of the XML format is embedded below. Follow the import_example_xml.xml link to github.com in order to download this file. Importing Once you have your records formatted correctly, navigate to the Import Multi Form Records page and begin importing your records into Kora. This will require 3 steps: uploading, matching fields and importing. Uploading records Upload correctly formatted record files by clicking the Add New File button. After clicking the button, you'll be able to select the files you want to upload from your computer. Once you've selected your files, select the forms that you want the records uploaded to by clicking on the Select Some Options bar. A dropdown menu will appear with the forms from your project. You will have to select your forms in the same order that your selected record files appear. If you have images or other types of files that you want put into records, they must be compressed into a zip file. Drag and drop that zipped files into the second box, or select the zipped file by clicking Or Select the Zipped File Here in the box. Files in the zip file can then be refered to in the imported record files. Once you have everything ready, press the Upload Record Import Files Field Matching Once you have uploaded the records and files that you want to import, you will be brought to the Field Matching tab on the Import Records page. This page allows you to associate the field names between the records you are uploading to the form you are importing the records to. Many of the fields will automatically map onto the correctly correlated field, but this is your opportunity to make sure everything is mapping correctly. Select fields if applicable on the right column of the page. * **Note**: If a field is *required* in the form you are importing records into, you must associate an incoming field to one that is being imported. Once everything looks correct, click the Upload Records button at the bottom of the screen. Import your records A loading page will open informing you that your import has begun. Depending on the number of records you are importing, it may take several minutes to complete. Do not close the page or browser until completion. When the import is complete, you will be automatically brought to the Import Records Complete page. Failed Record Import There are several reasons a record import will fail. If any of your records fail to import then a page will appear giving you a summary of the imported records. This page will tell you how many records were successfuly imported and give you a few options. Download Failed Records (JSON) : You may download the records that failed to import. This will download as a JSON. Downloading this along with the failed record repots will help to identify the problem(s) with the import. Download Failed Records Report : This will download a report with error messages telling you why particular records failed to import. The Failed Records Report will state which fields are required. If you did not match your field types correctly, the Failed Records Report may give you an error: {\"18\":\"Unable to determine error. This is usually caused by a structure issue in your CSV\\/XML\\/JSON, or an unexpected bug in kora.\"}. If this occurs, we recommend trying to import your record(s) again after checking how the fields should be matched. Try Importing Again : This allows you to try importing records again.
