#Editing a Form
A [form](../forms/creating_a_form.md) is the mechanism by which you are able to generate [records](../records/creating_a_record.md). It is similar to a form that you would fill out to catalog an artifact or object. It can contain [multiple pages](../forms/creating_a_multipage_form.md) and various [field types](../forms/understanding_field_types.md). A form will determine the types of metadata that is generated for a project. Each [project](../projects/creating_a_project.md) can have multiple forms depending on the types of objects you are recording or who your target audience(s) are.

You may want to edit a form you have previously created, either to change the name of the form, edit the description, make the form a preset, edit users and administrators of the form, or to delete the form.

Follow the steps below to edit a form:

1. [Open your current project](../accessing_and_managing_projects_from_the_dashboard.md) (You can find the list of your projects by clicking on the *Projects* button on the top menu).
